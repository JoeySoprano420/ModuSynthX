# ModuSynthX

ModuSynthX is a declarative-hybrid language where modifiers shape execution, control flow, and memory behavior. It uses spreadsheet-like reference models, is AOT compiled using a stack+cell grid, and includes a built-in VM for controlled execution and simulation. Garbage is handled via sifting (tiered time-based resource reclamation), and execution uses compress-release flows for dynamic memory uncompression.

It balances expressiveness with inferred abstractionâ€”leaning on contextual understanding only when code cannot be meaningfully or efficiently described in linear form.
